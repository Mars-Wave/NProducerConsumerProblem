# NProducerConsumerProblem

Compiling: Running the line that is commented out in the first lines of the main.c file (gcc -lpthread -o m.o main.c) for that main.c file the resulting file is m.o. To run it, in a Linux machine run command ./m.o.

Using that line it is possible to change BUFFERSIZE, PRODUCERSPEED, PRODUCERS, CONSUMERS and CONSUMERSPEED inside main.c, then recompile and observe the changes. Under every configuration within the limits of real possibility it should work the intended way.
